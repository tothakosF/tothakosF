Hi! My name is *Ákos Tóth* and I am an **IT system operator**.
=================================================================================================================================

I've been actively coding since I was 12. Started with scratch as a kid, then high schooI came around and I decided to apply for a prestigious school where I can code, learn about networks and use databases. All of that gave me the basics and started my journey in IT :)

For more information about me, my recent projects and competitions check out my [website](https://www.it-kalauz.com)!

The majority of my projects revolve around automation, crafting useful scripts for everyday tasks, WPF user interfaces for easy accessibility for other programs and some red teaming projects.
