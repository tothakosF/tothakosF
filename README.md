Hi! My name is *√Åkos T√≥th* and I am an **IT system operator**.
=================================================================================================================================

I've been actively coding since I was 12. Started with scratch as a kid, then high schooI came around and I decided to apply for a prestigious school where I can code, learn about networks and use databases. All of that gave me the basics and started my journey in IT :)

In March of 2024 I got into the finals of the National Profession Competition (OSZTV) within my field: IT system operator. Fought hard and secured the 11th place among the 559 competitors. It was a fun experience! I met some of the smartest guys in IT and travelled all the way to V√°c to take part in a near 5 hour challange held for the best 12 students in the country.

The majority of my projects revolve around automation, crafting useful scripts for everyday tasks, WPF user interfaces for easy accessibility for other programs and some red teaming projects.
